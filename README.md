I've uploaded a zip file of the entire code work, where  `Deliverable12.ipynb`, `Deliverable3.ipynb`, and `Deliverable4.ipynb` correspond to the code requirements in `HW3.pdf`. 

**Deliverable 1 → `Deliverable12.ipynb`**

**Deliverable 2 → `Deliverable12.ipynb`**

**Deliverable 3 → `Deliverable3.ipynb`**

**Deliverable 4 → `Deliverable4.ipynb`**

If the notebook files were saved correctly, the corresponding answers and deliverables should be expected in the outputs.
The data and prediction results can be obtained through link[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YWcX3z9NfSAJZD43XVD02ORWepbyZgRH/view?usp=sharing]

Note: `Deliverable4.ipynb` uses a lot of functions defined in `utils_coco.py` (to handle importing annotations, calculating mAP, etc.).
